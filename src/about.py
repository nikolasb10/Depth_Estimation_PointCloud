    ### üîç Depth Estimation & Point Cloud Visualization
    
    This application demonstrates advanced computer vision techniques for:
    
    **Depth Estimation:**
    - Uses state-of-the-art MiDaS and DPT models
    - Estimates depth from single monocular images
    - Supports multiple model architectures for different speed/quality trade-offs
    
    **Point Cloud Generation:**
    - Converts 2D images + depth maps into 3D point clouds
    - Includes color information from original images
    - Supports downsampling and filtering for optimization
    
    **Key Features:**
    - Multiple pre-trained depth estimation models
    - Interactive parameter tuning
    - Export capabilities (depth maps, point clouds)
    - Optimized for both quality and performance
    
    ### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
    
    **Models Used:**
    - **DPT-Large**: Highest quality, uses Vision Transformer architecture
